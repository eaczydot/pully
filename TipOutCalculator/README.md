## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd TipOutCalculator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS simulator (requires macOS)
npm run ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android

# Run in web browser
npm run web
```

## Usage

### Navigation
- **Horizontal carousel**: Swipe left/right for employee selection
- **Vertical wheel**: Swipe up/down for role selection
- **Progress bar**: Shows current step in the process
- **Back/Next buttons**: Traditional navigation when needed

### Tip Calculation Logic
1. **Total Tips**: Enter the full amount to be distributed
2. **Barback Allocation**: 20% of total tips automatically allocated
3. **Bartender Pool**: Remaining 80% distributed among bartenders
4. **Hour-based Distribution**: Each person's share = (their hours / total hours in role) √ó role pool

### Example Calculation
- Total Tips: $1,000
- Barback Pool: $200 (20%)
- Bartender Pool: $800 (80%)

If bartender worked 8 hours out of 24 total bartender hours:
- Their share: (8/24) √ó $800 = $266.67

### Changing Barback Percentage
Edit the `supportStaffPercentage` value in the initial state (App.js):
```javascript
const [tipData, setTipData] = useState({
  totalTips: 0,
  bartenders: [],
  supportStaff: [],
  supportStaffPercentage: 20  // Change this value
});
```

### Carousel Styling
The carousel can be customized in `src/components/WheelPicker.js`:
- **Item width**: Change `ITEM_WIDTH` constant
- **Carousel height**: Modify `CAROUSEL_HEIGHT` constant
- **Colors**: Modify the `styles` object
- **Animation speed**: Adjust `tension` and `friction` in spring animations
- **Scale effects**: Modify the `outputRange` for scale interpolation

### Styling
All styles follow iOS design guidelines with:
- SF Pro font weights
- iOS color palette
- Native-feeling animations
- Proper spacing and typography
